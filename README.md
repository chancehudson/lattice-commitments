Structured lattice commitments based on [Baum et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/997.pdf)

## Usage

Clone the repo and run `cargo run`.

Change the configuration variables in [`main.rs`](./src/main.rs#L19) to adjust the base field and polynomial ring degree.

## Example output

```
Base field cardinality: 101
Polynomial ring: â„¤[X]/<X^64 + 1>
